# Philosopher AI ðŸ“œ

Welcome to the Philosopher AI project! I dived into this mainly to experiment with large language models (LLMs) and vector embeddings. The profound depths of philosophical works, especially "Meditations", caught my intrigue. A lot of cool insights, but hard to rememebr them all the first time around. So, I thought, why not bring ancient wisdom and modern tech together?

I started by gathering works from various philosophers, segmented them, and embedded the segments into Pinecone. To connect everything, I utilized LangChain to link a GPT model with the vector store, ensuring precise philosophical quotes without the GPT's usual hallucinations.
